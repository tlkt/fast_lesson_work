              "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

              "Text xxbos xxmaj riding xxmaj giants is a brilliant documentary that xxunk deep into the world of one of the most under - appreciated sports and brings to the surface a very human and raw emotion that only director xxmaj stacy xxmaj peralta could capture . xxmaj everything from the structure , to the players , to the amazing stock footage , to even the style in which this was filmed only xxunk the beauty and power behind the sport of surfing . xxmaj of all the surfing films that i have seen ( xxmaj endless xxmaj summer , xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk , and xxmaj step xxmaj into xxmaj liquid ) this was the most consistent and relevant . xxmaj beginning with the early ages of surfing ( a brief history lesson ) lasting all the way till xxmaj laird 's infamous ride , xxmaj riding xxmaj giants goes further into the mind , heart , and soul of the sport than any of these other documentaries . xxmaj how does it do this ? xxmaj by giving us the whole story , from start to finish , without xxunk or xxunk xxunk from wave to wave . \n",
              " \n",
              "  xxmaj to begin this film was structurally sound . xxmaj in the other films that i have seen about surfing , you sometimes find yourself jumping from new person to new person , wave to wave , event to event , without any knowledge of why or who ? xxmaj in xxmaj riding xxmaj giants , we have a very small cast of veterans and xxunk . xxmaj this allows you to really go deeper into the mind of each one . xxmaj also , instead of just riding waves , we are handed more history and more personal insight to the world than before . xxmaj this is what really attracted me to this film . i was impressed that instead of showing all these big waves ( because it is a big wave movie ) , we listen to stories and see first hand what these surfers had to overcome to get to those waves . i loved the information about the \" beach xxunk \" or father 's of surfing . i am still floored by the amazing tales of xxmaj greg xxmaj noll and his early adventures into the harsh deep blue . xxmaj then , to see him in person , talking about what was going on in his mind , only added more xxunk to the fire . xxmaj the xxunk structure that xxmaj peralta followed allowed me to follow and walk away with more knowledge of the sport than with any of the earlier films . xxmaj peralta shows so much emotion and passion that you can not help but be amazed by what these brave people have done , and where the sport is going . \n",
              " \n",
              "  xxmaj add to a immaculate structure some intense and creative cinematography , and you have darn near perfect film . xxmaj using techniques that i last saw in xxmaj the xxmaj kid xxmaj stays in the xxmaj picture , xxmaj riding xxmaj giants creates some scenes that almost feel as if they are jumping out of the screen . xxmaj while it is n't xxup 3d , it is that flat dimensional feeling that you get when you put two pictures on top of each other . xxmaj in this film , it worked . xxmaj it created more depth to the scenes , and really added to not just the shock value ( man these waves were huge ) , but also the danger that these guys constantly faced . xxmaj if it broke differently or they xxunk wrong , these waves would kill them . xxmaj some did die , but it did n't stop the sport . xxmaj it only created more excitement and more passion to do better . xxmaj it is this love of the ocean and sport that leads me to my final point . \n",
              " \n",
              "  xxmaj the human element . xxmaj so many of my earlier adventures in the world of surfing documentaries left me with beautiful waves , but very little about the people . xxmaj the films knew that people were watching for the waves , so it would basically go from wave to wave to wave and the maybe a short second about the person . xxmaj this film was the direct opposite . xxmaj peralta created this masterpiece by still giving us the waves , but xxunk so much more attention onto the surfers and the xxunk question of why they do this everyday . xxmaj what rushes through their minds , what pushes them to go further , and the bonds that are formed while out there on the wild blue xxunk . i felt like after watching this film that i not only knew more about big wave surfing , but also about the emotional side to the sport . xxmaj this was an element not as developed in the other films and pushed xxmaj riding xxmaj giants to a whole new personal level . \n",
              " \n",
              "  xxmaj overall , this film was brilliant . xxmaj never have i witnessed so much passion , devotion , and love wrapped in a structurally sound film . xxmaj from beginning to end , i was impressed . i would be very happy if this film won the xxmaj oscar this year for xxmaj best xxmaj documentary , and to see a new xxunk in the surfing world and open more doors for films of this nature . \n",

( xxmaj and at xxup no time can you ever believe in xxmaj ms. xxmaj joslyn 's xxmaj johanna ... ) xxmaj for me , the rest of the production was completely lost because of three out of the four major characters were so obviously miscast . i can not give a proper review of anything else because they were so distracting that they spoiled the rest of the production . i really ca n't understand why people rave about this badly - shot and self - conscious filming of a stage play . xxmaj surely there 's more to camera work in the theatre than just xxunk a camera down in the front row ? xxmaj if i want that , i 'll go to a decent play , preferably at the xxmaj stratford xxmaj festival , where at least they work together for the production and are n't constantly mugging for the camera . i give it three stars only because the quality of the production apart from the antics of xxmaj lansbury and xxmaj joslyn seems adequate if not spectacular . \n",
